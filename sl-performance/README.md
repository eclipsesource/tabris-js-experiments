## Run

In the project directory, run the [Tabris CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tabris-cli) command:

```
tabris serve
```

This will start a JavaScript app code server at a free port and print its URL to the console.

The JavaScript app code can be [side-loaded](https://tabrisjs.com/documentation/2.0/developer-app.html#the-developer-console) in the [developer app](https://tabrisjs.com/documentation/2.0/developer-app.html) if the default config.xml was not changed. Otherwise, the JavaScript app code must be side-loaded in a [debug build](https://tabrisjs.com/documentation/2.0/build.html#building-a-tabrisjs-app) of this app.

## Build

The app can be built using the online build service at [tabrisjs.com](https://tabrisjs.com) or locally using [Tabris.js CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tabris-cli).

See [Building a Tabris.js App](https://tabrisjs.com/documentation/2.0/build.html) for more information.
